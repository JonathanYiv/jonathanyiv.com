# Personal Resume/Portfolio Website

This is the source code for my personal resume/portfolio website.

Screenshot here...

My [first website](https://github.com/JonathanYiv/jonathanyiv.github.io) used Jekyll, GitHub Pages, and a pre-built theme called 'Minimal Mistakes.'

My intention with this iteration is to move away from that generic look to create a modern single-page site from scratch.

It will be hosted on Heroku and have HTTPS for a secure connection as opposed to GitHub Pages.

I also realized that I am not a blogger by any means; it's simply not in my nature.
Leaving up that section of my website would make it seem 'unkempt,' so.. no more blog.

I will be using CSS Grid and Flexbox.
